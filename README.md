# OpenGL Toy Project

This is a project to practice something basic I learned from Computer Graphics with one of its API - Opengl. I implement a very simple game engine in this project.

Development environment: Win10 + Visual Studio 2022

I mainly implements basic shader, texture, camera class, lighting and model loading.

From the overall photo, you can see I implement basic lighting including specular, diffuse and ambient light. And you can set light as you want, there are directional light, spot light and point light. 

I learn and realize basic material, camera class to display models and model loading function to load models.

I also implement simple render pipeline by generating and binding VAO, VBO and EBO.
