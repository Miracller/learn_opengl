# OpenGL Toy Project - Simple Game Engine

This is a project to practice something basic I learned from Computer Graphics with one of its API - Opengl. I implement a very simple game engine in this project.

Development environment: Win10 + Visual Studio

Library used: GLFW + GLEW

I mainly implements basic render pipeline, material class, camera class, lighting and model loading function.

From the overall photo, you can see I implement basic lighting including specular, diffuse and ambient light. And you can set lights as you want, there are directional light, spot light and point light. 

I learn and realize basic material, camera class to display models and model loading function to load models.

I also implement simple render pipeline by generating and binding VAO, VBO and EBO.
