# OpenGL Toy Project

This is a project to practice something basic I learned from Computer Graphics with one of its API - Opengl. 

Development environment: Win10 + Visual Studio 2022

I mainly implements basic shader, texture, camera class, lighting and model loading.

From the overall photo, you can see I implement basic lighting including specular, diffuse and ambient light.
I learn and realize basic material, camera class and model loading function.

I also implement simple render pipeline by generating and binding VAO, VBO and EBO.
